# **TYKHE** (PROTOTYPE) :zap:

## Challenge

The challenge proposed by SEBRAE and MCTIC (Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications) was focused in the foodservice sector and questioned how could companies conquer back their consumers after quarantine. Thus, our group came up with ideas of what solutions could contribute with the consumers' experiences and the success of businesses in the catering industry post COVID-19, and the final solution we came up with was as it follows.

## Project

This is the prototype for the solution we developed for the [MEGA HACK 3.0](https://www.megahack.com.br/) hackathon which was promoted by Shawee and had Gr1d, Github, Zenvia, Sai do Papel and Trybe as partners.

## The App :fork_and_knife:

The application aims at evaluating restaurants, with regard to the security and cleaning measures implemented to help prevent COVID-19 outbreak. The evaluation database is fed by users / clients who, in turn, earn points to be exchanged for discounts at restaurants registered on the platform.

In addition, restaurants can provide digital menus and photos of the establishment, in addition to creating new discounts to be enjoyed by their customers.
